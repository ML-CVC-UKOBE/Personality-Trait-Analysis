            <strong>Openness</strong> to experience (inventive/curious (<b>{{Openness}}</b>) vs. consistent/cautious (<b>{{nOpenness}}</b>)). Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure,
            unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity,
            creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person
            is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine.
            High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or
            drug taking.[5] Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean, in occupation and hobby, towards the arts,
            being, typically, creative and appreciative of the significance of intellectual and artistic pursuits.[6] Moreover,
            individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense,
            euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are
            characterized as pragmatic and data-drivenâ€”sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded.

            <b>Conscientiousness</b> (efficient/organized (<b>{{Conscientiousness}}</b>) vs. easy-going/careless (<b>{{nConscientiousness}}</b>) ). Tendency to be organized and dependable, show
        self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior.
        High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with
        flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.[7]

            <b>Extraversion</b> (outgoing/energetic (<b>{{Extraversion}}</b>)  vs. solitary/reserved (<b>{{nExtraversion}}</b>) ). Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness,
        sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is
        often perceived as attention-seeking and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality,
        which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed.[7] Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings,
        as opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.[8]

            <b>Agreeableness</b> (friendly/compassionate (<b>{{Agreeableness}}</b>)  vs. challenging/detached (<b>{{nAgreeableness}}</b>) ). Tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather
        than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether
        a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness
        personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentative or untrustworthy.[7]

            <b>Neuroticism</b> (sensitive/nervous (<b>{{Neuroticism}}</b>)  vs. secure/confident (<b>{{nNeuroticism}}</b>) ). Tendency to be prone to psychological stress.[9]
        The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability.
        Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to
        by its low pole, "emotional stability". High stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be
        seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. Low stability manifests as the reactive and excitable personality often found in
        dynamic individuals, but can be perceived as unstable or insecure.[7] Also, individuals with higher levels of
        neuroticism tend to have worse psychological well being.[10]
